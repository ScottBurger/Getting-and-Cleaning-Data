First I load the `dplyr` package, used for joins and filtering later on. Then I set the working directory to the UCI dataset.

```
library(dplyr)

setwd("C:/Users/v-scburg/Desktop/UCI HAR Dataset")
```
Here is step 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

```
x_train <- read.table("train/X_train.txt",nrows=7353)
x_test <- read.table("test/X_test.txt",nrows=2948)
xmerge <- rbind(x_train,x_test)

y_train <- read.table("train/y_train.txt",nrows=7353)
y_test <- read.table("test/y_test.txt",nrows=2948)
ymerge <- rbind(y_train,y_test)

subject_train <- read.table("train/subject_train.txt",nrows=7353)
subject_test <- read.table("test/subject_test.txt",nrows=2948)
smerge <- rbind(subject_train,subject_test)
```


Here is step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

```
features <- read.table("features.txt")
features_mean_std <- filter(features, grepl('mean|std', V2))

xkeep <- xmerge[,features_mean_std$V1]
colnames(xkeep) <- features_mean_std$V2
```






Here I have combined step 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set, and step 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

```
colnames(smerge) <- c("subject")

activity_labels <- read.table("activity_labels.txt")
colnames(activity_labels) <- c("activity_label","activity")

colnames(ymerge) <- c("activity_label")
ymerge_activity_join <- left_join(ymerge,activity_labels)

full_merge <- cbind(smerge,ymerge_activity_join,xkeep)

full_merge$activity_label <- NULL
```


Finally step 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

```
groupmeans <- full_merge %>% group_by(subject,activity) %>% summarise_each(funs(mean))

write.table(groupmeans,file = "tidy.txt", row.names = FALSE)
```
